- Currently, all native projects are compiling in 32 bit mode.  On Windows this is more or less default, but on OS X this had to be specially set up.  The GLEW library makefiles were altered slightly to accommodate this.  For this reason, the architecture on the projects is set to “32 bit intel”, and the “Automatic reference counting” feature for Objective C was disabled ( not supported in 32 bit mode ).
