- GLEW, and any other external libraries, should be put into a new folder called “Prebuilt”, under LifecycleTools. : [DONE]

- replace all “WIN32/__APPLE_/…” define checks with “LCT_…” equivalents

- Move all "debug menu" related resources ( font buffers, graphics device, etc. ) into the Menu class for easier re-use

- Start using the "Services" struct convention for passing shared pointers around at the application level ( ie: not LCT )
